# Bi-Weighted Oriented Optical Flow (Bi-WOOF)

The first attempt is proposed to encode essential expressiveness of the apex frame.
It utilizes two frames (i.e., onset and apex frames) from the micro-expression video sequence to perform the emotion recognition.
Promising performance had been achieved when evaluated on CASME II and SMIC databases. 

Example of micro-expressions:

The recognition algorithm contains three main steps: 
(1) The horizontal and vertical optical flow vectors between the apex and neutral frames are estimated; 
(2) The orientation, magnitude and optical strain of each pixelâ€™s location are computed from the respective two optical flow components; 
(3) A Bi-WOOF histogram is formed based on the orientation, with magnitude locally weighted and optical strain globally weighted.
